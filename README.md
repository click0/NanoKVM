## Opensource & Contribution & Shipping

The star is coming to 2K! We will organize and opensource backend source code in Mid October！(and it is also the time all preoreders  (before 10.1) ship out)

### Update 10.18

We have opensourced the backend code in 10.8, and thank you for Civil PR it immediately, we will give you newest NanoKVM-PCIe as a reward！

## Hardware platform NanoKVM

NanoKVM is based on Sipeed [LicheeRV Nano](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/zh/lichee/RV_Nano/1_intro.html)，you can find specifications, schematics, and dimensional drawings [here](http://cn.dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeRV_Nano).

The NanoKVM Lite is constructed by the LicheeRV Nano and HDMItoCSI board, and the NanoKVM FULL adds the NanoKVM-A/B board and shell to the NanoKVM Lite. The HDMItoCSI board is used to convert the HDMI signal; NanoKVM-A, including OLED, ATX control output (USB Type-C interface), auxiliary power supply and ATX power on/off and reset buttons; The NanoKVM-B is connected to the plate at one end and the computer at the other end is connected to the computer ATX-Pin, which is used to remotely control the power of the computer.

The NanoKVM image is built on LicheeRV Nano SDK and MaixCDK, and is compatible with materials that use the LicheeRV Nano, opposite the KVM software cannot be used with the LicheeRV Nano or other SG2002 products. If you would like to build an HDMI input application on LicheeRV Nano or MaixCam, please contact us for technical support.

Note: Out of the 256MB memory in SG2002, 105MB is currently allocated for the multimedia subsystem, which NanoKVM will use for video image acquisition and processing
